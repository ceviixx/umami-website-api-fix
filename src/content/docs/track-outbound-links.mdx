title: Track outbound links
---

When a user clicks on a link to an external site, this event is normally not captured because
the user is leaving the site where Umami runs. However, using [events](/docs/track-events) you can
track this behavior.

To track outbound links, you need to add data attributes to the anchor tag containing the external link.
When the tag is clicked, the event will be triggered. In this example, we are sending
an event named `outbound-link-click`.

```html
<a href="https://www.external-website.com"
  data-umami-event="outbound-link-click"
  data-umami-event-url="https://www.external-website.com"
>
  External link
</a>
```

If you don't want to manually update all you anchor tags, you can use this script to automatically add the
event attribute to all your outbound tags. You can place the following script at the bottom of your HTML body.

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  (() => {
    const name = 'outbound-link-click';
    document.querySelectorAll('a').forEach(a => {
      if (a.host !== window.location.host && !a.getAttribute('data-umami-event')) {
        a.setAttribute('data-umami-event', name);
        a.setAttribute('data-umami-event-url', a.href);
      }
    });
  })();
</script>
```
